1. Text coming out of nowhere on loading screen.......

                Acheived using gsap:-
                    gsap.from(".line h1",{
                        y:150,
                        stagger:0.3
                    })

                and css:- 

                    .line{
                        height: fit-content;
                        overflow: hidden;
                    }

Here the final position of the div is 150px below the orignal 
but due to overflow being hidden we cant see it and it looks 
as if the text is coming out of nowhere with each h1 staggering
0.3sec behind each other.


2.Making the counter using setinterval in js...

                ->Select the element that you want the countdown to 
                run on.

                let h5timer = document.querySelector(".count h5");
                let grow = 0;
                var intervalId = setInterval(function() {
                    if (grow < 100) {
                        h5timer.innerHTML = grow++;
                    } else {
                        h5timer.innerHTML = grow;
                        clearInterval(intervalId); // Stop the interval
                    }
                }, 100);

its simple gpt the code if not understood.

3. Main page sliding up the removing the loader.

                 tl.to(".loader",{  //tl is timeline of gsap
                opacity:0,
                duration: 0.3,
                delay: 2.5
            })

            tl.from(".page1",{
                delay:0.2,
                duration:0.5,
                y:1600,
                ease: Power4  //Google
            })

here, we need to turn the opacity down and make sure that
body has the same color as the loader.
just move the main page form y = 1400 to orignal postion giving
the effect as if it moved in.

4. The flicker in the now word was obtained by using the 
@keyframes.
